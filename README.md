# SearchX

I have hardcoded few search terms that will give results.

# For testing
  - Typing any query starting with "test" or with "react" will show suggestions.
  - Clicking on any suggestions from the list or "Enter" key from the keyboard
  will show the results for that query (only few terms have results)
